# Timberdoodle

Home of colaboration grown graphics engine by MatÄ›j Sakmary and Patrick Ahrens.

This engine is used as a basis for our research projects and general education in graphics programming.

explicit goals of this project:
* comment features and abstractions with blocks of text in the respective files
* make big comments explaining a complex part of the engine in place
* properly consider, propagate and handle most runtime errors
* be consistent
* refactor regularly after gaining greater understanding of an aspect of the engine
* DO NOT overgeneralize

We will try to keep the engine very well maintainable. This will include many partial rewrites.
